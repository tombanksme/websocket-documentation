Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas. I am a full-stack developer based in the United Kingdom. I am currently
a third-year studying Computer Science at Newcastle University. This website contains the
documentation for my dissertation project; an object-oriented WebSocket library.

### Motivation

Some time ago I attempted to create a Discord clone using Typescript. The plan was to
transfer the voice, presence & text channel data over a WebSocket connection. While
developing a prototype I encountered multiple situations where I wanted to add methods
directly to the WebSocket connection/server objects. This is technically possible using
Javascript prototypes; however, it's not very developer-friendly and even more
complicated when using typescript.

I hypothesized that if the libraries were object-oriented and class-based, I could easily
add additional methods or change the logic of the library, without requiring a full
re-write.

When it came to choosing my dissertation project, I knew that this idea was something that
I wanted to pursue. This website contains the documentation for the finished product.

### Dissertation

I am currently writing the dissertation for this project. Once I've graduated I will
publish it here; for those of you who would like some light bed-time reading.
